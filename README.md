Petproject "Node.js socket chat"

VanillaJS driven interface

To run locally:
```
npm run
```
By default runs on 3000 port. Customize `.env` file at the project root to alter port (see `.env.example`)

Currently it's mostly broken and needs extensive refactoring

## TODO:

- Prettier interface
- Refactor sockets code
- Add authentication
- Add rooms
- Add DB-agnostic storage layer
